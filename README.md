# Noita Fungal Skip Mod

This mod for Noita allows players to skip the cooldown period for fungal shifts through an in-game UI button. This can be set up to only work if you're in holy mountains, or only work if you're outside of battle.

## Usage

- The skip button will appear in the bottom right corner of the screen during a fungal shift cooldown.
- Click the button to skip the cooldown if all conditions are met.

## Note

- This can be nice as a simple fungal cooldown indicator if you just turn off the "allow when xyz" options.
